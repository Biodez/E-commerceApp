# E-commerceApp

This application would be an e-commerce website for different types of laptops sales. signed in users can buy a laptop, add it to cart. There will be an admin signup and signin page, as well as user signup and signin page. There will also be a page where the admin can edit and also delete products. I intend to build all the CRUD functionality before the project presentation and also added some of the other features like adding to cart and payment if time allows.

MVP (What I must Include):
    - All the Admin functionalities (Sign in and Sign up Admin Page, adding new products, admin edit/delete page).

What I will like to have
    - All the User functionalities.
